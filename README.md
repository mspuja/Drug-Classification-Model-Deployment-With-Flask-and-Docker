# Drug-Classification-Model-Deployment-With-Flask-and-Docker
Here, we implemented Drug Classification Model Deployment by Flask and Docker with the help of Ngrok.

In Project_4.ipynb file we work with the pickle file of the model which is name as model.pkl

We install flask_ngrok and after that install ngrok via Apt 

Then we connect Ngrok to Google Drive Account which is shown by IMG_1.

Also install pyngrok from which ngrok has been imported.

Then upload the model.pkl file and templates.zip file and then unzip the templates.zip folder

In the model deployment with flask section import the necessary libraries

And use the personal Authtoken for ngrok which is shown by IMG_2.

After executing the cell we will get a url running http with ngrok.io which remains valid for 6hrs.

After clicking the url we will see our HTML File where we test our model deployment with Flask.

And then we creat the requirements.txt file.

After that we also implement the model with Docker which file is name as app.zip folder

In the Screenshot.zip Folder which contains all the pictures to show how the deployment working with ngrok.io

In IMG_1 and IMG_2 it shows the personal Authtoken for ngrok will be diiferent for each person.

To get the personal Authtoken for ngrok one has to open an account on ngrok.com
